To estimate the total stock investment by students in this school, two plans are proposed. Plan I would sample 30 students at random, find a confidence interval estimate of their average investment, and then multiply both ends of this interval by 1650 to get an interval estimate of the total investment. Plan II would sample 30 students at random from among the 132 who have investments in the market, find a confidence interval estimate of their average investment, and then multiply both ends of this interval by 132 to get an interval estimate of the total investment.

{"subject":"high_school_statistics","question":"Question: After receiving several complaints from his customers about the store being closed on Sundays, a storekeeper decided to conduct a survey. He randomly selected 100 female customers and 120 male customers, and asked them, \"Are you interested in shopping at this store on Sundays?\" He counted the number of customers answering \"yes\" and constructed a 95 percent confidence interval for the difference by subtracting the proportions of female from the proportion of male customers in favor of shopping on Sundays. The resulting interval was (\u20130.23, \u20130.18). Which of the following is a correct interpretation of the interval?\n\nOptions:\nA. We are 95 percent confident that the proportion of women interested in shopping on Sundays exceeds the proportion of men interested in shopping on Sundays.\nB.

The distribution of the masses is symmetric and mound-shaped with a mean of 54.1 grams and no outliers. The farmer conducted a t-test to see if there is evidence that the eggs from these hens have a mean mass that is different from 56 g and got a test statistic of t= -1.973.
