{"subject":"high_school_computer_science","question":"Question: Two lists, list1 and list2, contain the names of books found in two different collections. A librarian wants to create newList, which will contain the names of all books found in either list, in alphabetical order, with duplicate entries removed.\n\n For example, if 1istl contains\n [\"Macbeth\", \"Frankenstein\", \"Jane Eyre\"]\n and 1ist2 contains\n [\"Frankenstein\", \"Dracula, \"Macbeth\", \"Hamlet\"],\n then newList will contain\n [\"Dracula\", \"Frankenstein\", \"Hamlet\", \"Jane Eyre\", \"Macbeth\"].\n\n The following procedures are available to create newList.\n Procedure\n Explanation\n Sort (list)\n Sorts list in alphabetical order and returns the resulting list.\n Combine (listl, list2)\n Creates a new list consisting of the entries from\n list1 followed by the entries from list2. The resulting list is returned.\n RemoveDuplicates (list)\n Iterates through list. If any two or more entries have the same value, the duplicate entries are removed so that any entry appears at most once. The resulting list is returned.\n\n Which of the following code segments will correctly create newList?\n\nOptions:\nA. newList \u2190 Combine (listl, list2)\n newList \u2190 Sort (newList)\n newList \u2190 RemoveDup1icates (newList)\nB. listl \u2190 Sort (listl)\n list2 \u2190 Sort (list2)\n newList \u2190 Combine (listl, list2)\n newList \u2190 RemoveDuplicates (newList)\nC. listl \u2190 RemoveDuplicates (listl)\n list2 \u2190 RemoveDuplicates (list2)\n newList \u2190 Combine (listl, 1ist2)\n newList \u2190 Sort (newList)\nD. listl \u2190 RemoveDuplicates (listl)\n listl \u2190 Sort (listl)\n list2 \u2190 RemoveDuplicates (list2)\n 1ist2 \u2190 Sort (list2)\n newList \u2190 Combine (listl, list2)\n\nAnswer:","answer":"A"}
