The function recursively splits the List into two halves and makes two recursive calls on each half until the size of the List becomes less than or equal to 5.\\n\\nGiven that the drop and take operations on a List have a complexity of Θ(n), the splitting of the List into two halves in each recursive call contributes to the overall time complexity. Since the List is divided into halves at each recursive call, the depth of recursion can be represented by a binary tree where each level represents a division of the List into halves.\\n\\nThe number of levels in the binary tree formed by the recursive calls is equivalent to the number of times the List can be divided by 2 until it reaches a size less than or equal to 5.

Mathematically, this is formalized as $\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\Pr [X=x|Y=y] = \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\Pr[X=x]$, meaning that the probability of a certain plaintext being the true message given the ciphertext is the same as the probability of that plaintext being the true message without knowing the ciphertext.\\\\n\\\\nThe other statements are not necessarily true in the context of perfect secrecy. \\\\\"$\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\Pr [X=x|Y=y] = \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\Pr[Y=y]$\\\\\" is not correct because if the probability of the plaintext given the ciphertext was equal to the probability of the ciphertext, it would mean that the ciphertext reveals information about the plaintext. \\\\\"$\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\Pr [X=x|Y=y] = \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\Pr[X=x,Y=y]$\\\\\" is also not correct because it implies that the probability of the plaintext given the ciphertext is the same as the joint probability of the plaintext and ciphertext, which may not be true.
