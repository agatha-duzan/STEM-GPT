{"subject":"high_school_physics","question":"Question: Standing waves are produced by a 100-Hz generator in a string of fixed length. The tension in the string is increased until a new set of standing waves is produced. Will the wavelength of the new standing waves be greater than or less than the wavelength of the original standing waves?\n\nOptions:\nA. Less, because the tension in the string varies directly with the wave speed, which varies inversely with the wavelength.\nB. Greater, because the tension in the string varies directly with the wave speed, which varies inversely with the wavelength.\nC. Greater, because the tension in the string varies directly with the wave speed, which varies directly with the wavelength.\nD.

{"subject":"high_school_physics","question":"Question: A 1-kg object is released from rest at the top of a rough-surfaced incline. The object slides without rotating to the bottom of the incline. The object\u2019s kinetic energy at the bottom must be\n\nOptions:\nA. Equal to the block\u2019s gravitational potential energy when it was released, because total mechanical energy must be conserved.\nB. Equal to the block\u2019s gravitational potential energy when it was released, because the gain in kinetic energy compensates for the mechanical energy lost to thermal energy on the rough incline.\nC. Less than the block\u2019s gravitational potential energy when it was released, because the gravitational potential energy was converted both to thermal energy and to kinetic energy.\nD. Less than the block\u2019s gravitational potential energy when it was released, because the work done by the friction force must be greater than the block\u2019s gain in kinetic energy.\n\nAnswer:","answer":"C"}
{"subject":"high_school_physics","question":"Question: It is known that a lab cart is moving east at 25 cm\/s at time t1 = 0.10 s, and then moving east at 15 cm\/s at t2 = 0.20 s. Is this enough information to determine the direction of the net force acting on the cart between t1 and t2?\n\nOptions:\nA. Yes, since we know the cart is slowing down, its momentum change is opposite the direction of movement, and the net force is in the direction of momentum change.\nB. No, because we don\u2019t know whether forces such as friction or air resistance might be acting on the cart.\nC. No, because we don\u2019t know the mass of the cart.\nD. Yes, since we know the cart keeps moving to the east, the net force must be in the direction of motion.\n\nAnswer:","answer":"A"}
